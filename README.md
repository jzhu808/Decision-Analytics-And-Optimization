# ISOM 677: Decision Analytics and Optimization
> Optimization and simulation are powerful techniques used, in general, to allow managers to make better decisions and, specifically, in data analytics. This course will introduce students to these techniques, in particular linear, integer and non-linear programming and monte carlo and discrete event simulation, and discuss their application to problems in business and data analytics. Models will be built using spreadsheets, an algebraic modelling system and specialized simulation software but focus will be on practical applications of the models and their use in solving real problems rather than on their mathematical properties.


### Group Projects
- [Project 1](https://github.com/jzhu808/ISOM-677-Decision-Analytics-And-Optimization/blob/master/ISOM%20677%20Shuttle%20Project%20Draft.pdf) - Analyze the performance of Emory University's Route C shuttle system, identify key gaps that lead to inefficiency, pressure test the shuttle system, and suggest pro-active solutions for anticipated or commonly experienced problems
  > Tools Used: RStudio, Simio, Gurobi, Python  
  Data Used: Emory University Shuttle C Operation Data
